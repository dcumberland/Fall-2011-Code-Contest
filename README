Welcome to the Fall 2011 Code Contest

The Challenge:
Given any startimg number between 1 and 99, there is a sequence of numbers from that starting number to the number 4.  The sequences always ends at 4 as 4 leads to itself.  The sequence is always the same for a given starting number.  Examples of the sequence are:

12 -> 6 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 4
1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 4
35 -> 10 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 4
61 -> 8 -> 5 -> 4 -> 4
72 -> 10 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 4

The challenge consists of two parts.
* Discover the algorithm that describes the number sequence.
* Submit working code that generates the sequence for all numbers between 1 and 99.

All entries must accept a command line paramter of the starting number and output the sequence as single line like shown above in the examples.

The contest ends on September 30th


The Prize:
The winning submition will be determined by the fastest execution time.  Should multiple entries be close on execution time, the winner will go to the cleanest code (easiest to read).
The first place award is $500.
Second place is $200 and third place is $50.

Entries must include the name and contact information for each member of the team.  Individuals and team efforts are judged and awarded equally.  All contestents must be current students of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.
