PROJECT TITLE: Fall 2011 Code Contest

AUTHORS:       Tyler Shopshire (tshopshi@calpoly.edu)

VERSION, DATE: v1, 09/26/2011

INFORMATION:   The java files are used to generate the array map seen in solver.c
               We copy pasted this array map into solver.c to save execution time,
               instead of building the list at Runtime.
               The algorithm to calculate and display the sequence are in solver.c
               Our c file does not do any checks for valid input which is intentional for speed.
               The program will not run correctly if an incorrect input is given.

HOW TO RUN:    First, compile the code        - 'make'
               Display the array map for 1-99 - 'java Builder'
               Execute the algorithm          - './solver  n' where 1 <= n <= 99
